* Introduction
This is a simple snake game I decided to make to study C++ while having
fun gaming ;D.

* Installation
** Dependencies
To install this game you will need only [[https://cmake.org/download/][CMake]] and [[https://conan.io/downloads.html][Conan C/C++ Package Manager]].

~Conan~ will then take care of installing the need packages, namely the [[https://www.sfml-dev.org/][sfml library]].

** Conan
To use conan you will need to have a conan profile, which tells it your basic system
info such as operational system, compiler version, etc. in profiles directory inside
your conan2 installation folder.

Following we have a general profile for linux developers.

#+begin_src dot :tangle no
[settings]
arch=x86_64
build_type=Debug
compiler=gcc
compiler.cppstd=20
compiler.libcxx=libstdc++11
compiler.version=13
os=Linux 
#+end_src

After you configure your profile, you need to run the following command
~conan install . --output-folder=build --build=missing --profile=your-profile~
from the directory where the snake game was cloned.

It tells conan to install all dependencies listed on the conanfile, according to your
system settings in your profile, in a build folder. If a certain dependency has a binary
in the repository conan uses it by default, but if it does not, conan will build it from
source.

** CMake
After installing the dependencies with conan, you will need to run
~cmake . --list-presets~, so you know the compilation presets configured by conan.

After that run ~cmake . --preset=your-preset~ and youâ€™re good to go.

** Compilation
To compile your program running ~cmake --build . --preset=your-preset~ should do the
trick.

** Binary
The generated binary is moved from the root Snake Game directory to
~build/Your-Preset/bin~.

* conanfile.txt
~conanfile.txt~ is needed so Conan knows what packages and their versions are needed.

#+begin_src dot :tangle conanfile.txt
  [requires]
  sfml/2.5.1

  [generators]
  CMakeDeps
  CMakeToolchain
#+end_src

* CMakeLists.txt
~CMakeLists.txt~ is needed so CMake knows the structure of our project to compile.

#+begin_src dot :tangle CMakeLists.txt
  cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.25.1)
  project(SnakeGame CXX)

  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 20)
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED YES)

  find_package(SFML REQUIRED)

  add_executable($(PROJECT_NAME) src/snake.cpp)

  # Make all executables be generated in the bin folder
  set(CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/bin)

  add_subdirectory(src)
  target_link_libraries(snake game)
  target_link_libraries(snake SFML::SFML)
#+end_src
